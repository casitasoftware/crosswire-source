/// The art plate on a library tile: `BannerRenderer`'s rendered banner once it
/// resolves, falling back to the entry's extracted icon centred on a tinted
/// ground while it does (or if rendering never succeeds).
///
/// Sizes itself to whatever width the grid cell gives it rather than taking a
/// fixed width, so tiles share the available space evenly and the grid has no
/// leftover gutter down one side.
///
/// This was the Phase 2 seam — wiring `BannerRenderer` in was a body-only
/// change, `GameTile` never touches the art directly.
/// `BannerRenderer.banner(forExe:size:)` takes an arbitrary `CGSize` and
/// composes proportionally, so a future banner needs no change to the
/// renderer, only a different `aspect` here.
