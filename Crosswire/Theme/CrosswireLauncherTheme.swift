import SwiftUI

/// Tokens for the Battle.net/Riot-style launcher surfaces, per
/// `docs/specs/visual-design-direction.md`.
///
/// Separate from `CrosswireTheme` because the launcher is its own design
/// language: a deeper, cooler, higher-contrast surface scale than the settings
/// chrome, with hero art and cover tiles to sit on it. `CrosswireTheme` keeps
/// serving Settings, About and the setup flow.
///
/// Both files are appearance-adaptive through `Color(light:dark:)`, which
/// resolves against the SwiftUI environment. `AppearancePreference` drives that
/// environment via a single `.preferredColorScheme(_:)` at the window root, so
/// the user's Dark / Light / System choice reaches every token here without any
/// view needing to consult it.
///
/// Rules of engagement (in addition to the four in `CrosswireTheme`):
/// 5. The background scale steps in deliberate increments — each level is a
///    perceptible lift on the one below, not a 1% nudge. Stay on the scale.
///    Elevation moves *toward* the page's extreme: lighter in Light, lighter in
///    Dark. Hover is the exception and moves against it, so a hovered card
///    reads as pressed-into rather than floating.
/// 6. The hero scrims and `textOnArt` are deliberately NOT adaptive. They sit on
///    rendered banner art, and `BannerImagePipeline` bakes a dark treatment into
///    every image it produces (42% ambient darkening plus a bottom scrim fading
///    to 78% black). Art is therefore dark in both appearances, so anything
///    layered on it stays calibrated for dark. Flipping these with the
///    appearance would put dark text on dark art.
